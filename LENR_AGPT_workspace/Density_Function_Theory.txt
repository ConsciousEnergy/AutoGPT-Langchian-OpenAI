Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics, chemistry, and materials science to investigate the electronic structure (principally the ground state) of many-body systems, in particular atoms, molecules, and the condensed phases. Density-functional theory (DFT) is a quantum-mechanical atomistic simulation method to compute a wide variety of properties of almost any kind of atomic, molecular, or bulk material. The theory is used in a wide range of applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, including the simulation of molecules, their interactions with surfaces, and the determination of electronic properties of materials.
