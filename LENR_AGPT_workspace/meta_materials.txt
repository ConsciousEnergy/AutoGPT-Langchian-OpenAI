Meta is from the Greek, meaning to “go beyond.” Metamaterials are a new class of functional materials, designed around unique patterns or structures, which cause them to interact with light and other forms of energy in ways that are not found in natural materials. They have potential applications in many fields, including telecommunications, energy conversion and storage, and medical technology. Meta Materials Inc. is one of the leading companies in this field and is responsible for many of the recent breakthroughs in metamaterials research.
