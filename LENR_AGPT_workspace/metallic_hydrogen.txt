Metallic hydrogen is a phase of hydrogen in which it behaves like an electrical conductor. This phase was predicted in 1935 on theoretical grounds by Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington. It has been claimed to be present in planets like Jupiter. In 2017, metallic hydrogen was created in the lab for the first time, by squeezing a sample of the element to pressures beyond what exists at the center of the Earth. Solid metallic hydrogen is thought to be a superconductor, able to conduct electricity without resistance. It may even be metastable. Metastable metallic hydrogen would be a very light-weight, low volume, powerful rocket propellant. One of the characteristics of a propellant is its specific impulse, which is the exhaust velocity of the propellant divided by the force per unit mass that the propellant exerts on the vehicle. The specific impulse of metallic hydrogen would be much higher than that of any other known propellant, potentially revolutionizing space travel.
