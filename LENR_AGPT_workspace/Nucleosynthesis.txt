Nucleosynthesis is the process by which new atomic nuclei are formed from pre-existing nucleons (protons and neutrons) and other nuclei. It occurs in several different contexts, including in the early universe, in stars, and during supernova explosions. The different types of nucleosynthesis include primordial nucleosynthesis, stellar nucleosynthesis, and explosive nucleosynthesis. Primordial nucleosynthesis occurred in the early universe, when the universe was still very hot and dense. Stellar nucleosynthesis occurs in stars, where nucleosynthesis is driven by nuclear fusion reactions that occur in the core of the star. Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs in supernova explosions, where the high energy and density of the explosion can cause new elements to be formed. By studying nucleosynthesis, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the origin and evolution of the elements in the universe.
