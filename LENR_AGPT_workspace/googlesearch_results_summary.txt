Keywords: nuclear reaction energy, energy released in nuclear fission, energy released in nuclear fusion\\nSources: Wolfram Alpha, Science Direct, Nuclear Energy Institute\\n\\nNuclear reactions involve the release of energy through processes such as nuclear fission and fusion. The energy released can be calculated using the formula E = Δm × c^2, where E is the energy released, Δm is the change in mass, and c is the speed of light. Nuclear fission involves the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, while nuclear fusion involves the merging of two lighter nuclei into a heavier nucleus. Uranium and plutonium are commonly used for fission reactions, while deuterium and tritium are used for fusion reactions. The energy released in nuclear reactions has many practical applications, including power generation and medical imaging.\\n
